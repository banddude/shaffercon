-- SERVICE FAQs (5 items)
INSERT INTO service_faqs (service_page_id, question, answer, faq_order) VALUES
  (862, 'Why do Pacific Palisades homes need whole building surge protection?', 'Pacific Palisades'' coastal location and proximity to the Santa Monica Mountains mean homes are at higher risk from lightning strikes and power grid fluctuations that can damage expensive electronics, smart home systems, and appliances. A whole building surge protection system safeguards your valuable property investment and ensures your home''s electrical systems remain protected year-round.', 1),

  (862, 'What''s the difference between whole building and outlet surge protectors?', 'Whole building surge protection starts at your electrical panel, protecting every circuit in your home simultaneously—ideal for comprehensive protection. Outlet surge protectors protect individual devices but don''t guard against surges entering through your main electrical service. Most Pacific Palisades homes benefit from both: a main system at the panel plus point-of-use protection for high-value equipment like home theaters and smart automation systems.', 2),

  (862, 'Does my Pacific Palisades home need lightning protection if I have surge protection?', 'Surge protection and lightning protection work together but serve different purposes. Surge protection guards against electrical spikes from the grid or power line switches, while lightning arrestors specifically prevent lightning from traveling through your home''s wiring. For a hillside home in Pacific Palisades with outdoor equipment, we often recommend both systems for maximum protection.', 3),

  (862, 'How long does whole building surge protection installation take?', 'Most residential surge protection installations in Pacific Palisades are completed within one business day, depending on your current electrical setup and whether the system requires grounding upgrades. Shaffer Construction handles all permitting, installation, and final inspection. We''ll give you an exact timeline during your consultation—no surprises.', 4),

  (862, 'Can Shaffer Construction integrate surge protection with my smart home system?', 'Yes, we specialize in surge protection for smart home installations, which is increasingly popular in Pacific Palisades. We can design a multi-level protection system that safeguards your smart devices, entertainment systems, and appliances while integrating seamlessly with your existing automation. Our team ensures everything is properly configured and protected from electrical surges.', 5);
