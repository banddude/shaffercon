INSERT INTO service_faqs (service_page_id, question, answer, faq_order) VALUES
  (880, 'Why do Pacific Palisades commercial buildings need whole building surge protection?', 'Pacific Palisades businesses face unique risks from coastal lightning storms and power grid fluctuations that can disable critical systems, corrupt data, and lead to expensive equipment failure. A comprehensive surge protection system protects your facility''s infrastructure, safeguards sensitive electronics, and ensures business continuity—especially important for companies handling client data or operating 24/7 facilities.', 1),

  (880, 'What''s the difference between commercial and residential surge protection systems?', 'Commercial systems are engineered for larger electrical loads, multiple circuits, and mission-critical equipment protection. They include coordinated multi-stage protection, advanced monitoring, and are designed to handle the electrical complexity of office buildings, retail spaces, and industrial facilities. Our commercial installations ensure your entire facility is protected, not just individual outlets.', 2),

  (880, 'How does surge protection protect my business data and equipment?', 'Electrical surges can corrupt files, crash servers, and damage expensive equipment like MRI machines, diagnostic devices, or manufacturing controls. A whole building surge protection system prevents these surges from reaching your critical equipment in the first place. Shaffer Construction designs systems tailored to your facility''s specific equipment and data protection needs.', 3),

  (880, 'How long does commercial surge protection installation take?', 'Commercial installations in Pacific Palisades typically take 1-3 days depending on your facility''s size and electrical complexity. Shaffer Construction coordinates all permitting, minimizes operational disruption, and ensures systems are fully tested before handoff. We work around your business schedule to complete the project efficiently while maintaining the highest safety standards.', 4),

  (880, 'Is surge protection required by code for Pacific Palisades commercial buildings?', 'Code requirements vary by building type and occupancy. Medical facilities, data centers, and certain commercial structures often require surge protection for compliance. Shaffer Construction stays current with all local and California electrical codes, and we ensure your installation meets or exceeds all regulatory requirements. We handle all permitting and final inspections so you stay compliant.', 5);
