INSERT INTO service_faqs (service_page_id, question, answer, faq_order) VALUES
  (873, 'Why do commercial buildings in Pacific Palisades need proper exhaust fan ventilation wiring?', 'Commercial properties in Pacific Palisades-including restaurants, offices, retail spaces, and facilities-require properly designed and installed exhaust ventilation to maintain indoor air quality, remove moisture and odors, and comply with local building codes. Inadequate ventilation can lead to air quality issues, equipment damage, mold growth, and code violations that prevent business operations. Shaffer Construction ensures your exhaust system is wired for reliable, code-compliant operation with proper electrical integration and controls that protect your business.', 1),

  (873, 'What makes commercial exhaust fan ventilation wiring different from residential systems in Pacific Palisades?', 'Commercial exhaust systems are significantly more complex than residential setups, often requiring multiple fans, makeup air coordination, specialized controls, and integration with building management systems. Pacific Palisades businesses need systems designed for continuous operation and higher airflow demands than typical homes. Our team handles all aspects-from initial load calculations to final electrical integration-ensuring your system meets commercial standards and operates efficiently without interruption.', 2),

  (873, 'How do you ensure exhaust ventilation compliance with Pacific Palisades and Los Angeles building codes?', 'Shaffer Construction stays current with Los Angeles and Pacific Palisades building codes, ensuring every exhaust installation meets or exceeds requirements for airflow rates, ductwork sizing, electrical connections, and safety mechanisms. We work with local building officials during permit review and inspections to guarantee compliance from design through final sign-off, protecting your business from code violations and operational issues.', 3),

  (873, 'Can existing commercial buildings in Pacific Palisades upgrade their exhaust ventilation systems?', 'Yes, we regularly upgrade exhaust systems in existing Pacific Palisades commercial buildings. Retrofitting can improve air quality, reduce energy waste through variable speed controls, and bring systems into code compliance. We assess your current setup and design upgrades that fit your space and operations while maintaining business continuity during installation-minimal disruption, maximum results.', 4),

  (873, 'What smart controls and monitoring options improve commercial exhaust system efficiency?', 'Modern commercial exhaust systems can include occupancy sensors, humidity controls, smart thermostat integration, and remote monitoring capabilities that optimize energy use by running fans only when needed. Variable frequency drives reduce energy consumption while maintaining proper ventilation, and monitoring systems alert you to maintenance needs before problems occur. Shaffer Construction integrates advanced controls that give you visibility and management of your building''s air quality and energy performance.', 5);
