  (860, 'How does motion-activated lighting improve home security in Pacific Palisades?', 'Motion-activated security lights deter potential intruders by illuminating dark areas around your home, making it difficult for anyone to approach your property undetected. In Pacific Palisades, where homes are often set back from the street and surrounded by landscaping, proper motion lighting is essential for protecting entry points, driveways, and perimeter areas. Shaffer Construction designs and installs systems tailored to your property''s layout, ensuring complete coverage without light waste.', 1),
